# Design Documentation for MNIST Neural Network Project

## Overview
This document provides an in-depth look at the design decisions, module interactions, and future extension plans for the MNIST Neural Network project. The goal of this project is to build a modular neural network from scratch, suitable for both educational purposes and future extensions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Module Interactions
- **Dataset Module (`dataset.py`):**  
  Provides functions to load raw IDX files, preprocess images (normalization and reshaping), and split data into training, validation, and test sets.
  
- **Neural Network Module (`neuralnet/`):**  
  - **network.py:** Contains the `NeuralNetwork` class that orchestrates the forward and backward passes, loss computation, and training loop.
  - **layers.py:** Implements a `Dense` layer with forward and backward propagation methods.
  - **activations.py:** Defines common activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, softmax) with proper error handling.
  - **losses.py:** Implements loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) and their derivatives.
  - **optimizers.py:** Contains a simple gradient descent optimizer to update weights.
  - **utils.py:** Utility functions for tasks such as weight initialization and one-hot encoding.

## Design Decisions
- **Modularity:**  
  Each functional unit (dataset handling, network layers, activations, loss, optimization) is separated into its own module, making it easy to replace or extend functionality.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Each function includes input validation and error handling to ensure robustness. Exceptions are raised with descriptive messages to facilitate debugging.

- **Documentation:**  
  Comprehensive inline documentation (docstrings) is provided for all functions and classes, adhering to the Google style guide. This helps new developers understand the code quickly.

- **Testing:**  
  Unit tests and integration tests are included in the `src/tests` directory to ensure that individual components and the complete training pipeline work as expected.

## Future Development Plans
- **Additional Layer Types:**  
  Extend `layers.py` to include convolutional, pooling, and recurrent layers.
  
- **Advanced Optimizers:**  
  Implement additional optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSProp) in `optimizers.py`.

- **Improved Data Handling:**  
  Add more sophisticated data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to the dataset module.

- **Scalability:**  
  Refactor the code to allow dynamic network configuration via configuration files or command-line arguments, facilitating experimentation with different architectures.

- **Integration with Other Projects:**  
  With the current modular design, components can be easily extracted and reused in other projects or integrated into larger frameworks.

## Conclusion
The MNIST Neural Network project is designed with modularity, robustness, and future scalability in mind. By following the guidelines laid out in this document, developers can extend or repurpose components for other projects without significant rework.
